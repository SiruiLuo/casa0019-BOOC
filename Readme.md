# UCL Library Occupancy Visualizer

![The BoOc](https://github.com/SiruiLuo/casa0019-BOOC/blob/main/Images/TheBooc.jpg)

## Project Overview
This group project is a data-visualizing device designed to acquire and display information about the occupancy levels of three libraries on the UCL campus using the UCL API. The device's core features a gauge housed within a book enclosure, which shows the selected library's live occupancy level in percentages for any given time between 9:00 and 17:00.

The integrated app for this device also generates a 3D augmentation of the book. It displays a detailed dashboard of information for each selected library, controlled by the buttons on the book. This device helps users better understand the state of each library through various mediums and visualizations.

## Key Components
1. **MCU ESP32**
2. **300 Degree Servo**
3. **E-Ink Screen**
4. **Neopixel Strip Light**

## Design Features
The enclosure of the device is designed to resemble a book complying with the overall subject of the project about libraries. The main box is made of 3mm laser-cut plywood and coloured to convey a majestic old look. The gauge, the E-ink screen and the buttons are embedded on a 3d printed plate and hand-painted to give a paper feeling. The use of the E-ink screen was also a decision towards maintaining the overall book feeling of the texts and images. 
1. **Book Closure**
2. **Magnetic Gauge**
3. **Interactive Buttons**
4. **E-Ink Screen**
5. **The Bookmark** (as a marker)
6. **Servo Magnetic Pin and Holders**

## Dashboard Design
1. **Real-time Occupancy Piechart**
2. **Weekly Average Occupancy Linechart**
3. **Library Maps**
4. **Date and Time**
5. **Seat Occupancy Counter**
